/// # 64 Bit
///
/// For 64 bit this is just the standard C packing and is fully
/// functional as a Rust struct.
///
/// # 32 Bit
///
/// On 32 bit this uses a packed representation.
///
/// Because Rust references must be aligned this means you cannot get
/// a reference to an individual item and instead must use
/// [std::ptr::read_unaligned] or [std::ptr::write_unaligned] after getting
/// the address with [std::ptr::addr_of]. The 32 bit access example below shows this.
///
/// # Basic Example
/// ```
/// use labview_interop::labview_layout;
///
/// labview_layout!(
/// pub struct TestStruct {
///     one: u8,
///     two: u16,
///     three: u32,
/// }
/// );
///
/// ```
///
/// # 32 Bit Reference Access
/// ```
/// use labview_interop::labview_layout;
/// use std::ptr::{addr_of, read_unaligned};
///
/// labview_layout!(
/// pub struct TestStruct {
///     one: u8,
///     two: u16,
///     three: u32,
/// }
/// );
///
/// let value = TestStruct {
///     one: 1,
///     two: 2,
///     three: 3
/// };
///
/// // Not allowed on 32 bit.
/// //let three_ref = &value.three;
/// unsafe {
///     let three_ptr: *const u32 = addr_of!(value.three);
///     let three: u32 = read_unaligned(three_ptr);
/// }
///
